# pymarc-extraction
Extracting marc fields using pymarc for subject analysis.

## Use case
These functions can be used to input a marc file and extract specific fields, outputting them to a csv file. It was originally intended to extract subject subfields to do metadata analysis.

## A Note about efficiency
Without a doubt there will be more efficient, or generally better ways to do this work. I'm still learning. If you use these functions and would like to share changes you make, feel free to comment in an issue or PR.

## Thank Yous
This wouldn't have been completed without borrowing code from by @rwangca (who also pulled late nights fixing my errors), @dicksonlaw583 , and the Carpentries pymarc lesson (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/pymarc_basics/)
